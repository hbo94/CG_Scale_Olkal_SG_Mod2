A new evolution of the famous Olkal CG Scale, tuned by S. Gamp, with a brand new software. 
I didn't change everything, of course, the main part of the original programm regarding the scale management is kept, because it works very well and provide a very accurate result. I have included a new library, very efficient to capture the key values, from Vedat Ozan Oner (https://www.codeproject.com/Tips/709109/ADKeyboard-Library-for-Arduino)

What'n new with this release for the scale part :

    a separate box has been designed, in which a keyboard and the OLED display take place.
    the main frame has been optimized to host correctly the 9v battery.
    a wire clamp system has been added, to save the wires
    a specific PCB has been designed to reduce the size of the components and have less wires into the box
    the new design enables the change of the load cell

For the software part :

    a interactive menu has been added for the initial configuration
    the autocalibration is optimized to take a very short time
    it is possible to choose the type of support (little, medium, large)
    the tare configuration menu is simpler and takes less memory
